In general it is better to have at least three projects:
WebApi (Controllers, responses)
Core (Business logic, dtos)
Data (Db connection, context, migrations, entities)
Tests
also we can have separate Infranstructure layer,
etc.
But for brevity here we have only one project,
that's why Migrations folder is automatically placed in top-level folder
and not in DataLayer folder,
and we have a lot of dependencies in this one and only project.
